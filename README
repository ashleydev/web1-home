This repo keeps my aliases and rc files, as well as plugins and perl scripts I wrote for doing day to day work on a *nix machine.

PS:  If you actually read through the bin/ folder, be advised that 90% of these scripts were written when I was learning Perl, and when I look back at then, I can't believe I ever did them "the hard way".
